      <h2>Therapists</h2>
      <span>Kendra Mulligan BScPT, CGIMS, FCAMPT</span>
      <p>
        Kendra graduated from the University of Alberta in 1993 and started her
        career in a progressive private practice manual therapy clinic offering
        excellent mentorship in Grande Prairie, AB. She worked in Northern
        Alberta for 18 years with 5 of those years owning a physical therapy
        practice and focusing on treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Kendra
        grew up on a cattle farm in Northern BC spending time in 4-H and was
        involved in community sports playing competitive fastball, slowpitch and
        recreational basketball and volleyball. Kendra is active in the local
        mountain biking community and enjoys nature and exploring local,
        regional and North American mountain biking destinations. In 2013,
        Kendra completed her FCAMPT certification - an internationally
        accredited program for utilizing clinical reasoning, exercise
        prescription, and manual therapy including manipulation for optimal
        treatment results. Kendra then continued to support the manual therapy
        education system with the Orthopedic division of the Canadian
        Physiotherapy Association by working as teaching assistant on manual
        therapy courses and offering mentorship to fellow physiotherapists. In
        2014, Kendra completed the University of Toronto Evidence Based Practice
        program. In November - April 2021, Kendra completed her Level 1
        Foundations of Anatomical Acupuncture and she has been certified in
        GunnIMS (dry needling) since 2007. Kendra has co-owned Ascent
        Physiotherapy in Comox, BC since 2010 with Ron Mulligan and is proud of
        the contributions that the clinic and physiotherapy staff have made to
        the Comox Valley by offering best practice, evidence based manual
        therapy and community activity involvement.
      </p>
      <span>Trish Leslie BScPT</span>
      <p>
        Trish graduated from Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh with a
        Bachelor's of Science in Physical Therapy, with honours, in 2011. She
        has worked as a physiotherapist in orthopaedics, women's health,
        geriatrics, neurology and sports physiotherapy. Trish has also worked
        with rugby players at the Leith Rugby Club in Edinburgh and James Bay
        Rugby Club in Victoria. Trish has worked in private practice as well as
        acute care since 2012. Through her practice she focuses on manual
        therapies, physiotherapy modalities and exercise prescription. Since
        graduating university she has continued to complete additional courses
        in orthopaedics and women's health as well as being certified in
        acupuncture from Acupuncture Foundation Canada Institute. Trish grew up
        in Ucluelet but is happy to have ended up in the Comox Valley and is
        loving it here.

      <span>Jared Hromika MPT, FDN/IMS</span>
      <p>
        Jared graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2014 with a
        Masters of Physical Therapy and moved to the Comox Valley with his wife
        in the summer of 2015. Before moving to the valley, he worked in
        Vancouver at several locum positions in private practice orthopaedics in
        order to gain exposure to different patient populations and approaches
        to treatment. This experience has helped Jared consider movement
        problems from different perspectives while providing a framework for his
        post graduate development. Jared's approach to treatment involves
        movement assessment, manual therapy techniques, and exercise
        prescription in order to help you move more effectively and with less
        pain. He also has additional training with Neurokinetic Therapy, which
        is a method of assessment and treatment for compensation patterns that
        have developed over the years and often go unnoticed. This helps direct
        treatment towards the cause of your symptoms and improve your overall
        quality of movement. In addition to physiotherapy treatment, Jared is
        excited to provide Ascent Physiotherapy with bike fitting services. He
        was introduced to triathlon in 2006 and has enjoyed working on his bikes
        ever since. While enrolled in the masters program at UBC, he completed
        additional training through the BC Division of Sport Physiotherapy
        Canada for rider assessment and bike fit to optimize a rider's
        efficiency and comfort in the saddle. When he's not in the clinic or on
        his bike, Jared enjoys many activities including swimming, trail
        running, softball and hockey.
